# Virtual Servers: Complete Technical Guide

Virtual servers (VDS/VPS) provide virtualized server instances with dedicated CPU cores, guaranteed RAM allocation, and full root access. Unlike shared hosting, virtual servers offer complete control over the operating system, software stack, and network configuration while sharing physical hardware resources with other instances.

## Definition and Overview

A **virtual server** (also known as VDS - Virtual Dedicated Server or VPS - Virtual Private Server) is a virtualized server instance provisioned on physical hardware using hypervisor technology. Virtual servers provide dedicated CPU cores, guaranteed RAM allocation, and full root access while sharing physical hardware resources with other instances.

Key characteristics:

- **Virtualization**: Server instances created using hypervisor technology (KVM, OpenVZ, etc.).
- **Dedicated resources**: Dedicated CPU cores and guaranteed RAM allocation per instance.
- **Full root access**: Complete control over operating system and software stack.
- **Resource isolation**: CPU, RAM, and network resources isolated from other instances.

## Why This Matters

Virtual servers provide a balance between cost-effectiveness and performance, making them ideal for small to medium-sized applications that require more control than shared hosting but don't need the full resources of dedicated servers.

Market drivers:

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Lower cost than dedicated servers while providing dedicated resources.
- **Scalability**: Easy scaling of resources (CPU, RAM, storage) as needed.
- **Flexibility**: Full control over operating system and software stack.
- **Isolation**: Resource isolation from other instances on the same physical server.
