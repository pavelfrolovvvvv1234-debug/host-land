# Dedicated Servers: Complete Technical Guide

Dedicated servers provide exclusive access to physical bare-metal hardware with no virtualization overhead, maximum CPU/RAM/I/O performance, and full control over operating system, network configuration, and IP addressing.

## Definition and Overview

A **dedicated server** is a physical bare-metal server with exclusive access to CPU, RAM, storage, and network interfaces. Unlike virtualized servers (VDS/VPS), dedicated servers provide no virtualization overhead, maximum performance, and full hardware isolation from other customers.

Key characteristics:

- **Exclusive hardware access**: Full access to all CPU cores, RAM, storage, and network interfaces.
- **No virtualization overhead**: Direct access to hardware without hypervisor layer.
- **Maximum performance**: Highest CPU, RAM, and I/O performance possible.
- **Full control**: Complete control over operating system, network configuration, and IP addressing.

## Why This Matters

High-performance applications (databases, CDN, streaming) and high-security workloads (compliance, isolation requirements) require dedicated server infrastructure. Virtualized alternatives (VDS/VPS) introduce virtualization overhead and resource sharing that limit performance and isolation.

Market drivers:

- **Performance requirements**: Applications requiring maximum CPU, RAM, and I/O performance.
- **Isolation requirements**: Compliance and security requirements for full hardware isolation.
- **IP control**: Requirements for custom IP addressing, BGP routing, and IP reputation management.
- **Cost optimization**: Long-term cost savings for high-resource workloads compared to cloud VPS.
