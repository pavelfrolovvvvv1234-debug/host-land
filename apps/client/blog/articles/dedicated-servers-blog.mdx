# Dedicated Servers: When You Need Bare-Metal, Performance, Isolation & IP Control

Dedicated servers provide exclusive access to physical bare-metal hardware with no virtualization overhead, maximum CPU/RAM/I/O performance, and full control over operating system, network configuration, and IP addressing. This article explains when to choose dedicated servers over virtualized alternatives, technical architecture considerations, performance characteristics, isolation benefits, IP management strategies, and deployment best practices for high-performance and high-security workloads.

## Definition and Overview

A **dedicated server** is a physical bare-metal server with exclusive access to CPU, RAM, storage, and network interfaces. Unlike virtualized servers (VDS/VPS), dedicated servers provide no virtualization overhead, maximum performance, and full hardware isolation from other customers.

Key characteristics:

- **Exclusive hardware access**: Full access to all CPU cores, RAM, storage, and network interfaces.
