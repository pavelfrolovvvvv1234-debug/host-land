# Bulletproof Dedicated Servers

Bulletproof dedicated servers provide exclusive access to physical hardware with bulletproof policies, keeping your bare-metal nodes online even when DMCA notices or abuse complaints arrive by placing hardware in offshore-friendly facilities across the USA, Netherlands, Germany and the EU.

## What is a Bulletproof Dedicated Server?

A bare-metal server hosted in offshore-friendly facilities that stays online during DMCA or abuse disputes while our team mediates complaints. Unlike VDS which shares physical resources, dedicated servers offer complete hardware isolation, predictable performance, and full root access for custom configurations.

## Who Needs Bulletproof Dedicated Servers?

Privacy-focused SaaS, ad platforms, fintech rails, cybersecurity labs and streaming/media mirrors require hardware that resists false-positive takedowns.

### Benefits

- **Dedicated CPUs and RAM** - Zero noisy neighbours, guaranteed resources
- **Root-level customization** - For custom hypervisors, clusters and appliances
- **Optional IP announcements** - BGP sessions for complex networks
- **Guaranteed performance** - No resource sharing or contention

## How Dior Host Hardens the Hardware

We deploy Tier III facilities in NL/DE/MD with redundant power, on-site stock, hot spares and 24/7 NOC escalation paths.

### Hardware Features

- 1–10 Gbps ports with burst and upgrade options
- Hardware RAID for data redundancy
- ECC RAM for error correction
- AES-NI acceleration for encryption
- Private backhaul to partner POPs in NYC, LON, AMS and FRA

## Compliance & Abuse Handling

Abuse tickets trigger human review, mediation windows and DMCA-ignored handling until a legal mandate arrives.

### Policy

- **Zero-tolerance** only for malware, child abuse, terrorism
- Optional contracts and documentation for regulated partners
- Dedicated account managers for confidential escalations
- Manual review process - no automatic suspensions

## When to Choose Dedicated Over VDS

Dedicated servers become necessary when workloads require:

- **Guaranteed CPU performance** - No CPU sharing
- **Consistent I/O throughput** - Dedicated storage controllers
- **Specialized hardware** - Custom kernel modules, GPUs, etc.
- **Database-heavy applications** - High-frequency transactions
- **High-frequency trading** - Ultra-low latency requirements
- **Media encoding pipelines** - CPU-intensive processing

## How to Deploy

### Step 1: Define Workloads and Legal Exposure

Map services, traffic patterns, data sensitivity and potential complaint types.

### Step 2: Pick Jurisdictions & IP Strategy

Choose NL/DE/MD/US-friendly racks, required subnets and routing preferences.

### Step 3: Select Hardware Tiers

Match CPU generation, RAM, storage, bandwidth and mitigation add-ons to growth plans.

### Step 4: Launch & Governance

Schedule provisioning, import images, establish abuse contacts and monitoring.

## Bulletproof Dedicated vs Regular Dedicated

| Factor | Bulletproof Dedicated | Regular Dedicated |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Abuse workflow** | Manual mediation, DMCA ignored by default | Automatic shutdown at first complaint |
| **Jurisdictions** | Offshore NL/DE/MD racks + US-friendly peers | One domestic data center |
| **Privacy** | Crypto/wire, optional KYC, private tickets | Strict AML/KYC and shared ticketing |
| **Network & mitigation** | 10 Gbps uplinks, Anycast scrubbing, ACL automation | Basic 1 Gbps port, minimal DDoS cover |
| **Scaling** | Burst, stack or hybridize with VDS/Turbo nodes | Manual migrations, extra contracts |
