# Virtual Servers (VDS)

Virtual servers, also known as VDS (Virtual Dedicated Server), provide isolated virtual environments on shared physical hardware. Unlike bulletproof VDS, regular virtual servers do not have abuse-resistant policies and complaints are not ignored.

## What are Virtual Servers?

Virtual servers are virtualized server instances that provide dedicated resources (CPU, RAM, storage) within a virtualized environment. Each VDS operates independently with its own operating system and full root access.

### Key Features

- **Dedicated resources** - Guaranteed CPU, RAM, and storage
- **Full root access** - Complete control over the server
- **Choice of OS** - Linux or Windows operating systems
- **Scalability** - Easy to upgrade resources as needed
- **Isolation** - Your server is isolated from other users

## Use Cases

Regular virtual servers are suitable for:

- **Web hosting** - Hosting websites and applications
- **Development** - Testing and development environments
- **Backup storage** - Secondary backup locations
- **Low-risk projects** - Content that doesn't attract complaints
- **Business applications** - CRM, ERP, and other business tools

## Important Notes

**Abuse Policy**: Regular VDS servers do NOT have abuse-resistant policies. Complaints and DMCA notices are handled according to standard hosting policies, which may result in account suspension.

**Jurisdictions**: Regular VDS uses standard datacenters without special offshore protection.

**Privacy**: Standard KYC and billing requirements apply.
