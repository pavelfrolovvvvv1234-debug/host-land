# Dedicated Servers

Dedicated servers provide exclusive access to physical hardware, offering complete control, predictable performance, and dedicated resources without sharing with other users.

## What is a Dedicated Server?

A dedicated server is a physical server entirely allocated to a single client. Unlike virtual servers (VDS), dedicated servers provide exclusive access to all hardware resources including CPU, RAM, storage, and network interfaces.

### Key Benefits

- **Exclusive hardware access** - No resource sharing
- **Predictable performance** - No "noisy neighbor" issues
- **Full customization** - Complete control over hardware configuration
- **High performance** - Suitable for resource-intensive applications
- **Security** - Physical isolation from other users

## Use Cases

Dedicated servers are ideal for:

- **High-traffic websites** - Websites with millions of visitors
- **Database servers** - Large databases requiring high I/O
- **Game servers** - Low latency requirements
- **Media processing** - Video encoding, image processing
- **Enterprise applications** - CRM, ERP, and business-critical software
- **Development environments** - Large-scale development projects

## When to Choose Dedicated Servers

Choose dedicated servers when you need:

- **Guaranteed performance** - No CPU or I/O sharing
- **High resource requirements** - 32+ GB RAM, multiple CPU cores
- **Custom hardware** - Specialized requirements (GPUs, etc.)
- **Compliance requirements** - Regulatory compliance needs
- **Maximum control** - Complete hardware and software control

## Comparison with VDS

| Feature | Dedicated Server | VDS (Virtual Server) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Hardware** | Physical server | Virtualized |
| **Resources** | Exclusive | Shared physical hardware |
| **Performance** | Predictable | May vary |
| **Cost** | Higher | Lower |
| **Scalability** | Limited by hardware | Easy to scale |
| **Control** | Complete | Limited by virtualization |

## Server Specifications

Dedicated servers are available in various configurations:

- **RAM**: 16-128+ GB
- **Storage**: 250 GB - 2 TB+ (SSD/NVMe)
- **Network**: 1-10 Gbps
- **Bandwidth**: Unlimited

## Operating Systems

Both Linux and Windows operating systems are available:

- **Linux**: CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.
- **Windows**: Windows Server 2019/2022

## Management Options

- **Unmanaged** - Full control, you manage everything
- **Managed** - We handle updates, monitoring, and maintenance
- **Semi-managed** - Hybrid approach with support for specific tasks

## FAQ

**What's the difference between dedicated and VDS?**
