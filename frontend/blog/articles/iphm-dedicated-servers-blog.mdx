# Dedicated Server with IPHM: IP History Management Explained, Benefits, Anti-Abuse Logic

IP History Management (IPHM) is a service that provides dedicated servers with IP addresses that have clean reputation history and minimal abuse complaints. Unlike standard dedicated servers, IPHM servers use IP addresses that have been carefully vetted for reputation, reducing the risk of blacklisting, email deliverability issues, and network reputation problems. This article explains IPHM architecture, reputation management, anti-abuse logic, use cases, and deployment strategies for high-reputation workloads.

## Definition and Overview

**IP History Management (IPHM)** is a service that provides dedicated servers with IP addresses that have been carefully selected and managed for clean reputation history. IPHM servers use IP addresses that have minimal abuse complaints, clean blacklist records, and positive reputation scores, reducing the risk of blacklisting and network reputation issues.

Key characteristics:

- **Clean IP reputation**: IP addresses with minimal abuse complaints and blacklist records.
- **Reputation monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of IP addresses against blacklists and reputation databases.
- **Automatic rotation**: Automatic IP rotation when blacklisting or reputation degradation occurs.
- **Reputation scoring**: IP addresses scored based on historical abuse complaints and blacklist records.

## Why This Matters

Standard dedicated servers may use IP addresses with unknown or negative reputation history, leading to blacklisting, email deliverability issues, and network reputation problems. IPHM addresses this by providing IP addresses with clean reputation history and proactive reputation management.

Market drivers:

- **Email deliverability**: Clean IP addresses improve email deliverability and reduce spam filtering.
- **Network reputation**: Positive IP reputation reduces the risk of blacklisting and network blocks.
- **Abuse mitigation**: Proactive reputation management reduces the risk of abuse complaints and account termination.

## Technical Architecture

### IP Reputation Management

**Reputation databases**:

- **Spamhaus**: DNS-based blacklist (DBL) and IP blacklist (SBL, XBL, PBL).
- **SURBL**: URI-based blacklist for spam and phishing URLs.
- **Barracuda**: Reputation-based email filtering and IP reputation scoring.
- **Sender Score**: Return Path's IP reputation scoring system (0–100 scale).

**Reputation scoring**:

- **Clean IPs**: IP addresses with no blacklist records and minimal abuse complaints (score 90–100).
- **Good IPs**: IP addresses with minor blacklist records or isolated abuse complaints (score 70–89).
- **Fair IPs**: IP addresses with moderate blacklist records or recurring abuse complaints (score 50–69).
- **Poor IPs**: IP addresses with significant blacklist records or frequent abuse complaints (score 0–49).

### IP Selection Process

**IP vetting**:

1. **Historical analysis**: Review of IP address history for abuse complaints and blacklist records.
2. **Reputation scoring**: Calculation of reputation score based on historical data.
3. **Blacklist checking**: Verification against major blacklists (Spamhaus, SURBL, etc.).
4. **Selection**: Selection of IP addresses with clean reputation (score 90–100).

**IP allocation**:

- **Static allocation**: IP addresses allocated statically to dedicated servers.
- **IP ranges**: Optional IP ranges (/29, /28, /27, etc.) for multiple IP addresses.
- **IPv6 support**: Optional IPv6 prefixes (/64 or /48) with reputation management.

### Reputation Monitoring

**Continuous monitoring**:

- **Blacklist monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of IP addresses against blacklists (Spamhaus, SURBL, etc.).
